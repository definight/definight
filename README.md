## About me

 <details>

 <summary>Short bio</summary>
 WIP
   <!---
  <p>
     I got interested in software and hardware at a preschool age, in the 1998-1999 years, at the time of 512 MB RAM and Intel Pentium 3. When i was 13, I built my first PC and I even still remember all the specs.
   </p>
<p>
    Internet literally changed my life. I realized how much people can discover just by surfing online but staying at home. I started spending many hours online: browsing Wikipedia, reading news from the countries around the world, discovering new tools like Photoshop or social networks.
   </p> 
<p>
    But computers and Internet always were like a hobby for me, before I asked myself: what stops me from getting a job in IT? I tried my skills in 2013-2014 as a QA engineer in a small team on freelance. But the job didn't pay well. I had to pay bills and loans, so I decide to get back to retail as a shop assistant.
   </p>
<p>
     Then I changed my job to logistics as a courier; that job was boring, nervous, and with no career progression. The more I worked, the often I thought about my software/hardware/IT background. And one day at the morning I made two decisions, that changed my life to much better track: quit job, and get a degree as a QA engineer.
   </p> 
<p>
   I got a temporary job to earn money for the education, worked hard up to 6 days a week , and up to 16 hours a day, cut my spendings as much as possible. After a 6 months I've earned enough to pay for QA course, so i quit my job and get all myself into education.
   </p>
<p>
   In summary, now I'm a QA engineer and an advanced PC user for over 16 years
