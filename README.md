## About me

[I began to be interested in software and hardware at a preschool age, at the time of 512 mb RAM and Intel Pentium 3. At the age of 13 I built my first PC and I even still remember all the specs. Internet literally changed my life. I realized how much people can discover just by surfing online but staying at home. I started spending many hours online: browsing Wikipedia, reading news from the countries around the world, discovering new tools like Photoshop or social networks. But computers and Internet always was like a hobby for me, before I asked myself: what stopping me get a job in IT? I tried my skills in 2013-2014 years as a QA engineer in small team on freelance. But job didn't pay well, I had to pay bills and loans, so I decide to get back to retail as a shop assistant. Then I changed my job to logistics as a courier, that job was boring, nervous and with no career progression. The more i worked, the often I thought about my software/hardware/IT background. And one day at the morning I made two decisions, that changed my life to much better track: quit job and get a degree as a QA engineer. I got a temporary job, worked hard 6/1 and up to 16 hours a day, cut my spendings to max. After a 6 months I've earned
In summary, I'm a QA engineer and an advanced PC user for over 16 years]: <>
